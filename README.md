# GDW-Minigame-Spring-2021
Endless runner game where your goal is to dodge the obstacles and not fall off the map.
Title: Capsule Runner
Description: The game is an endless runner where your goal is to dodge as many obstacles as you can and to not fall off of the map.
Controls: "W" to move forward. "A" and "D" to move left and right
Interesting features: One feature I was very proud of was making the level infinite and that I could get the objects to spawn in the path. I just need to figure out where they spawn.
Assets: Only used primitives.
